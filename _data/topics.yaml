  blurb: How do people learn to make better decisions from experience?
  description: >
     <p>Traditionally, research on decision making has focussed on
     "decisions from description", for instance asking people to choose between
     two monetary gambles. Decades of research in this paradigm has led to the
     conclusion that human decisions are generally irrational (e.g., defying
     the laws of expected utility theory). In daily life, however, people
     rarely decide between options that are as precisely and exhaustively
     described as the gambles in traditional decision-making experiments.
     Rather, they need to learn to make decisions based on their own direct
     experiences in uncertain and noisy environments. Results from traditional
     studies often do not generalize to experience-based decision making. For
     instance, given sufficient experience, violations of expected utility
     theory tend to diminish <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}
     /publications/#speekenbrink2010learningenvironment">(Speekenbrink
     & Shanks, 2013)</a>. Even when
     descriptions are provided, people rely more strongly on their experience
     (Weiss-Cohen et al., 2016).</p>

     <p>Experience-based decisions are initially highly uncertain: people can
     only learn about the likely outcomes of their decisions by taking them
     and experiencing their consequences. This leads to an
     exploration-exploitation tradeoff: in uncertain environments, we should
     sometimes forego actions that we think are most rewarding (exploitation)
     in order to learn about the consequences of other actions with more
     uncertain outcomes (exploration). For instance, rather than always
     revisiting your favourite restaurant, it can be good to sometimes visit a
     new restaurant in order to see whether it is better than your current
     favourite. Exploration is especially pertinent in changing environments,
     where once optimal options can be overtaken by once poor options. This
     means the uncertainty about options should increase the longer they
     haven’t been tried. We showed that explorative decisions are guided by
     such uncertainty and that people explore more when the environment changes
     rapidly (Speekenbrink & Konstantinidis, 2015). A relatively simple
     mechanism accounted for people’s decisions, sampling for each option a
     reward from a subjective predictive distribution and choosing the option
     with the highest sampled reward. This results in a “probability matching”
     strategy where options are chosen according to the subjective probability
     that they provide the highest reward. Whilst probability matching has
     long been thought irrational, this strategy naturally combines exploitation
     and exploration and is near-optimal in complex and changing environments.
     Subsequent research (Schulz et al., 2015) again showed evidence for this
     probability matching strategy and further converging evidence comes from
     previous work (Speekenbrink & Shanks, 2010) which showed that people make
     predictions in changing environments by sampling from subjective
     (Bayesian) distributions.</p>

  blurb: How do people use sensory information to decide which action to take?
  description: >
   Many decisions can be supported by evidence. We are interested
   in how people evaluate and integrate different sources of
   information and how this relates to characteristics of the
   evidence sources such as their reliability. Perceptual decision
   making is an area in which these characteristics can be
   precisely controlled. While it is known that the perceptual
   system integrates information (close to) optimally, the
   precise mechanisms which allow this performance are not
   fully understood yet.

  blurb: How do people learn by observing traces of other peoples actions?
  description: >
    Given the dire news about global warming, we often ask why people don't do
    more to protect the environment. But let's look at it from a different
    angle: Why would you engage in behaviour to mitigate climate change?

    Almost all energy-saving behaviours have two things in common:

    <ol>
    <li>A certain cost (from going the extra mile to recycle glass bottles
    at a designated container to installing insulation on your house)</li>
    <li>The fact that a single individual's contribution is minimal and cannot,
    in itself, determine the desirable outcome (however much you do, one person
    drastically reducing energy use will not reverse the impacts of climate
    change).</li>
    </ol>

    Given the cost and the insignificance of the individual behaviour, it would
    seem rational to free-ride, i.e., not contribute to the generation of
    this "Public Good" and instead take advantage of other people's
    contributions. However, as the number of free-riders increases, the system
    breaks and everyone is in a worse position than had they contributed in the
    first instance. In Game Theory this is known as the "Tragedy of the
    Commons". Different ways to avoid the Tragedy of the Commons have
    previously been discussed, e.g. privatisation of the commons or punishment
    for free-riders. With regards to climate change, these options are limited:
    Privatisation only works for certain goods (for instance, air and water
    cannot be privatised); punishment requires agreement on policies and is
    difficult to implement on a global scale.

    In this project, we are thus looking at a third option, namely how
    cooperation can evolve in the creation of Public Goods. We focus on how
    behaviours and their traces (i.e., signs of the behaviour that remain in
    the shared, physical environment) can foster cooperation without direct
    communication and, crucially, without coercion.

  blurb: Optimize experiments whilst you run them
  description: >
    Experiments are usually designed "statically", before they
    are conducted. While this allows a large
    degree of experimenter control, in order to design an experiment
    optimally, we usually need to know
    quite a bit about the expected behaviour of participants in an
    experiment. Moreover, even if we
    succeed in designing an experiment optimally for an average participant, when there are large
    individual differences, the design will be suboptimal for a large proportion of participants. In
    adaptive design, an experiment is designed "on the fly", while it is running. Using computational
    models, we can determine relevant characteristics of a participant from their earlier behaviour, and
    tailor the design to the participant. This can have substantial benefits when conducting studies to
    e.g. compare different theories.

  blurb: Relation between social learning and mental health disorders
  description: >
    Many psychiatric disorders are chiefly characterised by deficits in social
    functioning, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychopathy, Social
    Anxiety, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Others exhibit social interaction
    impairments as a debilitating consequence of the disorder, such as higher
    distress from interpersonal relationships in Depression and interpersonal
    aggression as a barrier to effective treatment in PTSD. While there is
    little disagreement on the importance of understanding social interaction
    impairment in many of these disorders, there remains multiple unanswered
    questions as to what exactly in the social cognitive process is impaired
    or dysfunctional compared to healthy individuals. There are likely multiple
    dimensions that can interact to yield the observed atypical behavior in
    social interaction such as such as how sensitive is the person to specific
    social gestures, how good they are at inferring others intentions from their
    behavior and their ability to accurately infer social uncertainty from the
    history of interactions.

    The objective of the research project is to
    explore and hopefully learn to disentangle these dimensions through
    computationally modelling behavior in repeated economic games with
    social components. Along the way, we hope to develop behavioral markers
    of social dysfunction in mental disorders that can be used to diagnose,
    monitor and better understand the determinants of social learning
    impairment inherent to many conditions.
