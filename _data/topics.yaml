  blurb: How do people learn to make better decisions from experience?
  description: >
     Traditional research on decision-making is often focussed on
     how people make "decisions under risk" in well-described
     situations (e.g., gambles). For instance, someone might be asked
     whether they prefer to play Gamble A, in which there is an 20%
     chance of winning 8 pounds, or Gamble B, in which there is a
     30% chance of winning 6 pounds. In every-day life, decision
     problems are rarely encountered in such a neatly packaged
     format. Instead, people need to experience the outcomes of their
     actions and learn which actions are usually better than others.
     This leads to the so-called exploration/exploitation dilemma:
     people can either make a decision to obtain the best
     outcome, or make a decision in order to obtain more information
     about which alternative course of action is best. We investigate
     how people resolve this dilemma.

  blurb: How do people use sensory information to decide which action to take?
  description: >
   Many decisions can be supported by evidence. We are interested
   in how people evaluate and integrate different sources of
   information and how this relates to characteristics of the
   evidence sources such as their reliability. Perceptual decision
   making is an area in which these characteristics can be
   precisely controlled. While it is known that the perceptual
   system integrates information (close to) optimally, the
   precise mechanisms which allow this performance are not
   fully understood yet.

  blurb: How do people learn by observing traces of other peoples actions?
  description: >
    Given the dire news about global warming, we often ask why people don't do
    more to protect the environment. But let's look at it from a different
    angle: Why would you engage in behaviour to mitigate climate change?

    Almost all energy-saving behaviours have two things in common:

    <ol>
    <li>A certain cost (from going the extra mile to recycle glass bottles
    at a designated container to installing extra insulation on you house)</li>
    <li>The fact that a single individual's contribution is minimal and cannot,
    in itself, determine the desirable outcome (however much you do, one person
    drastically reducing energy use will not reverse the impacts of climate
    change).</li>
    </ol>

    Given the cost and the insignificance of the individual behaviour, it would
    seem rational to free-ride, i.e., not contribute to the generation of
    this "Public Good" and instead take advantage of other people's
    contributions. However, as the number of free-riders increases, the system
    breaks and everyone is in a worse position than had they contributed in the
    first instance. This is known in Game Theory as the "Tragedy of the
    Commons". Different ways to avoid the Tragedy of the Commons have
    previously been discussed, e.g. privatisation of the commons or punishment
    for free-riders. With regards to climate change, these options are limited:
    Privatisation only works for certain goods (for instance, air and water
    cannot be privatised); punishment requires agreement on policies and is
    difficult to implement on a global scale.

    In this project, we are thus looking at a third option, namely how
    cooperation can evolve in the creation of Public Goods. We focus on how
    behaviours and their traces (i.e., signs of the behaviour that remain in
    the physical environment) can foster cooperation without direct
    communication and, crucially, without coercion.

  blurb: Optimize experiments whilst you run them
  description: >
    Experiments are usually designed "statically", before they
    are conducted. While this allows a large
    degree of experimenter control, in order to design an experiment
    optimally, we usually need to know
    quite a bit about the expected behaviour of participants in an
    experiment. Moreover, even if we
    succeed in designing an experiment optimally for an average participant, when there are large
    individual differences, the design will be suboptimal for a large proportion of participants. In
    adaptive design, an experiment is designed "on the fly", while it is running. Using computational
    models, we can determine relevant characteristics of a participant from their earlier behaviour, and
    tailor the design to the participant. This can have substantial benefits when conducting studies to
    e.g. compare different theories.
