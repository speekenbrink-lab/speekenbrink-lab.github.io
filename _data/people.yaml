  blurb: In my research, I focus on how learning from others informs individual
          behaviour and decision making. That is, if we have evidence of other people’s
          behaviour without being able to query the reasoning behind the behaviour
          (e.g., observing recycling bins ready for collection outside someone’s
          house), how does that influence our own behaviour? - Do we recycle more,
          maybe because it appears to be a social norm? Recycle less because someone
          else is taking care of environmental problems, giving us the chance to
          free-ride? Infer the goal and apply it to a different area (reduce water
          consumption, for instance)? I am going to mainly use behavioural experiments
          and agent based modelling to answer these questions.

  blurb: My research mainly focusses on perceptual decision making. I'm
         currently investigating how people use information about reliability. For
         example, 2 samples could give you the same information about the ratio of
         coloured balls in an urn - sample 1 could contain 5 pink and 3 blue balls,
         and sample 2 could contain 25 pink and 15 blue balls. Thus the ratio
         information is the same, but an ideal observer should give greater weight
         to the larger sample as it is more reliable. This seems to be what people do.
         I'm also comparing various models that can account for this decision process,
         as well as starting to collect EEG data as people perform the task.

  blurb: My research mainly focuses on active learning. I use machine
         learning techniques to probe how humans and other agents can and
         should actively learn about mostly continuous relations. I believe
         that when we gather information about our environment, it is not the
         case that we passively perceive our surroundings. Rather, we engage
         actively with our learning environment by asking useful questions.
         From a statistical perspective, these problems can be tackled by
         taking a (Bayesian) optimal design perspective, where the goal is
         to sequentially minimize uncertainty through efficient queries. At
         the moment I am investigating Gaussian processes (sometimes called
         Kriging methods) as non-parametric methods to efficiently learn and/or
         maximize functions over time. In the long run, I want to find out why
         humans learn as well as they do by mathematically describing them as
         information seeking agents and taking the passivity out of cognitive
         models. Other interests are modern applied statistics in general as
         well as the history of psychology.
  movingon_blurb: Eric first joined the lab as an MSc student in 2010, then
                  as an MRes student in 2013, and finally as a PhD student
                  (2014 - 2017). Eric worked on various projects, focusing in
                  particular on functional generalization in reinforcement
                  learning with Gaussian Processes.
                  After leaving the lab, he became a Harvard

  blurb: I am a graduate student at the Department of Economics & Business,
         Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, currently on a research visit
         the Speekenbrink lab. My main research interest is to understand
         cognitive processes that underlie human learning and decision making.
         I am focusing my efforts on two projects related to multi-attribute
         decision situations. The first is concerned with how individuals
         select which decision strategy to use in choosing between
         alternatives. This is popularly called a "deciding how to decide"
         problem and I am trying to determine whether reinforcement learning
         is a good description of how individuals solve the problem. The second
         is related to the cognitive mechanisms that individuals employ to
         learn how to utilize attributes in order to infer utilities of
         alternatives. This knowledge of relationships between attributes
         and utilities is an important input to decision strategies that I
         study in the first project. In my research I use formal modeling and
         develop behavioural experiments to evaluate model predictions.

                  with Robin Hogarth at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in

                  2017. We worked on various projects related to reinforcement
                  learning, contextual bandits, and strategy selection.
                  After receiving his PhD, he was a postdoc at UCL, working
                  with Ray Dolan. He now works as a research scientist
