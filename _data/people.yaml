          behaviour without being able to query the reasoning behind the behaviour
          (e.g., observing recycling bins ready for collection outside someone’s
          house), how does that influence our own behaviour? - Do we recycle more,
          maybe because it appears to be a social norm? Recycle less because someone
          else is taking care of environmental problems, giving us the chance to
          free-ride? Infer the goal and apply it to a different area (reduce water
          consumption, for instance)? I am going to mainly use behavioural experiments
          and agent based modelling to answer these questions.

  blurb: My research mainly focusses on perceptual decision making. I'm
         currently investigating how people use information about reliability. For
         example, 2 samples could give you the same information about the ratio of
         coloured balls in an urn - sample 1 could contain 5 pink and 3 blue balls,
         and sample 2 could contain 25 pink and 15 blue balls. Thus the ratio
         information is the same, but an ideal observer should give greater weight
         to the larger sample as it is more reliable. This seems to be what people do.
         I'm also comparing various models that can account for this decision process,
         as well as starting to collect EEG data as people perform the task.

  blurb: My research mainly focuses on active learning. I use machine
         learning techniques to probe how humans and other agents can and
         should actively learn about mostly continuous relations. I believe
         that when we gather information about our environment, it is not the
         case that we passively perceive our surroundings. Rather, we engage
         actively with our learning environment by asking useful questions.
         From a statistical perspective, these problems can be tackled by
         taking a (Bayesian) optimal design perspective, where the goal is
         to sequentially minimize uncertainty through efficient queries. At
         the moment I am investigating Gaussian processes (sometimes called
         Kriging methods) as non-parametric methods to efficiently learn and/or
         maximize functions over time. In the long run, I want to find out why
         humans learn as well as they do by mathematically describing them as
         information seeking agents and taking the passivity out of cognitive
         models. Other interests are modern applied statistics in general as
         well as the history of psychology.
  movingon_blurb: Eric first joined the lab as an MSc student in 2010, then
                  as an MRes student in 2013, and finally as a PhD student

                  particular on functional generalization in reinforcement
                  learning with Gaussian Processes.

  blurb: I am a graduate student at the Department of Economics & Business,
         Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, currently on a research visit
         the Speekenbrink lab. My main research interest is to understand
         cognitive processes that underlie human learning and decision making.
         I am focusing my efforts on two projects related to multi-attribute
         decision situations. The first is concerned with how individuals
         select which decision strategy to use in choosing between
         alternatives. This is popularly called a "deciding how to decide"
         problem and I am trying to determine whether reinforcement learning
         is a good description of how individuals solve the problem. The second
         is related to the cognitive mechanisms that individuals employ to
         learn how to utilize attributes in order to infer utilities of
         alternatives. This knowledge of relationships between attributes
         and utilities is an important input to decision strategies that I
         study in the first project. In my research I use formal modeling and
         develop behavioural experiments to evaluate model predictions.
  movingon_blurb: Hrvoje first visited the lab in 2014 whilst a PhD student
                  with Robin Hogarth at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in

                  2017. We worked on various projects related to reinforcement
                  learning, contextual bandits, and strategy selection.
                  After receiving his PhD, he was a postdoc at UCL, working
                  with Ray Dolan. He now works as a research scientist
                  at SecondMind

  blurb: "My MSc project investigates the impact of behavioural traces on green
         behaviour. More specifically, the project explores the following
         question: can people’s choice of elevator or stairs be influenced by
         showing them the choices made by others? This question will be
         examined by making otherwise invisible behavioural traces (i.e.
         choice of elevator or stairs) visible and testing their impact on
         behaviour."

  blurb: "My project investigates the role of transfer learning and
         generalization in human reinforcement learning. To what
        extent do humans employ knowledge of past, related environments to
        generalize and make inferences in novel environments?
        This is tested in a compositional multi-armed bandit task where the
        reward function is composed of previously learned functions. I also
        investigate how well kernel-based models describe human generalization."

  blurb: My research project focuses on whether people can track how changeable
         the environment is (the level of volatility), and how this influences
         their rate of learning. To test this, I have developed an online game
         in which players need to predict the location of a school of fish.
         Tracking changes in volatility is a difficult computational problem,
         and we have developed particle filter algorithms which solve this
         task in order to have a benchmark against which to compare human
         behavior.
  movingon_blurb: Akhat conducted his BSc Psychology research on how people
                  learn about the volatility in the environment and how this
                  affects their rate of learning.
