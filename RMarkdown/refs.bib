  Abstract                 = {We present a new modeling framework for recognition memory and repetition priming based on signal detection theory. We use this framework to specify and test the predictions of 4 models: (a) a single-system (SS) model, in which one continuous memory signal drives recognition and priming; (b) a multiple-systems-1 (MS1) model, in which completely independent memory signals (such as explicit and implicit memory) drive recognition and priming; (c) a multiple-systems-2 (MS2) model, in which there are also 2 memory signals, but some degree of dependence is allowed between these 2 signals (and this model subsumes the SS and MS1 models as special cases); and (d) a dual-process signal detection (DPSD1) model, 1 possible extension of a dual-process theory of recognition (Yonelinas, 1994) to priming, in which a signal detection model is augmented by an independent recollection process. The predictions of the models are tested in a continuous-identification-with-recognition paradigm in both normal adults (Experiments 1-3) and amnesic individuals (using data from Conroy, Hopkins, \& Squire, 2005). The SS model predicted numerous results in advance. These were not predicted by the MS1 model, though could be accommodated by the more flexible MS2 model. Importantly, measures of overall model fit favored the SS model over the others. These results illustrate a new, formal approach to testing theories of explicit and implicit memory.},

  Abstract                 = {Interacting with a system is key to uncovering its causal structure. A computational framework for interventional causal learning has been developed over the last decade, but how real causal learners might achieve or approximate the computations entailed by this framework is still poorly understood. Here we describe an interactive computer task in which participants were incentivized to learn the structure of probabilistic causal systems through free selection of multiple interventions. We develop models of participants' intervention choices and online structure judgments, using expected utility gain, probability gain, and information gain and introducing plausible memory and processing constraints. We find that successful participants are best described by a model that acts to maximize information (rather than expected score or probability of being correct); that forgets much of the evidence received in earlier trials; but that mitigates this by being conservative, preferring structures consistent with earlier stated beliefs. We explore 2 heuristics that partly explain how participants might be approximating these models without explicitly representing or updating a hypothesis space.},

In the Dentist Directory of the Dutch Dental Association 51 professors were found of which 23 were still active; 45 were interviewed. The answers were categorized into 5 groups. The majority of the respondents (n = 31) mentioned as the most important development in dental science in the past century the gathered knowledge of the preventive effects of fluoride and the wide application of it in practice. The foundation of the dental health insurance in the Dutch National Health system was seen as the most significant development in Dutch dental care in this period (n = x32). More than half of the group (n = 26) was worried about the future demand of dentists and about the coming problems of supply and demand of dental care. It is concluded that the results of this study seem to be an accurate representation of the opinions of Dutch dentist professors on the main developments in dental science and Dutch dental care in the period 1900-2000. Respondents were pleased with the dental advances in the past century but they felt uneasy for the coming 25 years, especially concerning the issue of the availability of dental care for the majority of the Dutch population.},

Adolescents have a greater likelihood of taking risks when they are with peers rather than alone. In this study, we investigated the development of social influence on risk perception from late childhood through adulthood. Five hundred and sixty-three participants rated the riskiness of everyday situations and were then informed about the ratings of a social-influence group (teenagers or adults) before rating each situation again. All age groups showed a significant social-influence effect, changing their risk ratings in the direction of the provided ratings; this social-influence effect decreased with age. Most age groups adjusted their ratings more to conform to the ratings of the adult social-influence group than to the ratings of the teenager social-influence group. Only young adolescents were more strongly influenced by the teenager social-influence group than they were by the adult social-influence group, which suggests that to early adolescents, the opinions of other teenagers about risk matter more than the opinions of adults.},

  Abstract                 = {The close relation between time and causality is undisputed, but there is a paucity of research on how people use temporal information to inform their causal judgments. Experiment 1 examined the effect of delay variability on
causal judgments, and whether participants were sensitive to the presence of a hastener cue that reduced the delay between cause and effect without changing the contingency. The results showed that higher causal ratings were given to cause-effect pairs with less variable delays, but that conditions with an active hastener actually reduced participantsâ ratings of
the causal cues. The latter finding can also be explained in terms of peopleâs sensitivity to variability, because an undetected hastener leads to greater variability in experienced delays. Experiment 2 followed up previous research showing that people give higher causal ratings to cause-effect pairs with shorter delays. We examined whether this finding might
be due to the greater probability of intervening events rather than the length of delay per se. The results supported the
former conjecture: participantsâ causal ratings were influenced by the probability of intervening events in the cause-effect
interval and not the mere length of delay. The findings from both experiments raise questions for current theories of causal learning.},

  Abstract                 = {Multitasking is part of the everyday lives of both adolescents and adults. We often multitask during social interactions by simultaneously keeping track of other non-social information. Here, we examined how keeping track of non-social information impacts the ability to navigate social interactions in adolescents and adults. Participants aged 11â17 and 22â30 years old were instructed to carry out two tasks, one social and one non-social, within each trial. The social task involved referential communication, requiring participants to use social cues to guide their decisions, which sometimes required taking a different perspective. The non-social task manipulated cognitive load by requiring participants to remember non-social information in the form of one two-digit number (low load) or three two-digit numbers (high load) presented before each social task stimulus. Participants showed performance deficits when under high cognitive load and when the social task involved taking a different perspective, and individual differences in both trait perspective taking and working memory capacity predicted performance. Overall, adolescents were less adept at multitasking than adults when under high cognitive load. These results suggest that multitasking during social interactions incurs performance deficits, and that adolescents are more sensitive than adults to the effects of cognitive load while multitasking.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of our study was to investigate two inter-related hypotheses about the role of the subthalamic nucleus. First that the subthalamic nucleus plays a role in adjusting response thresholds and speed-accuracy trade-offs and second that it is involved in reactive and proactive inhibition and conflict resolution. These were addressed by comparing the performance of 10 patients with Parkinson's disease treated with right subthalamotomy and 12 patients with left subthalamotomy, to 14 unoperated patients with Parkinson's disease and 23 age-matched healthy control participants on a conditional stop signal task and applying the drift diffusion model. Unilateral subthalamotomy significantly improved Parkinson's disease motor signs. Patients with right subthalamotomy had significantly faster Go reaction times with their contra-lesional hand than the unoperated patients and did not differ from the control participants, indicating their speed of response initiation was 'normalized'. However, operated patients made significantly more discrimination errors than unoperated patients and controls, suggesting that subthalamotomy influenced speed-accuracy trade-offs. This was confirmed by the drift diffusion model, revealing that while the unoperated patients had significantly lower drift rate and higher response thresholds than the control participants, the response thresholds for the operated groups did not differ from the controls and the patients with right subthalamotomy had a significantly higher drift rate than unoperated patients and similar to that of controls. The drift diffusion model further established that unlike the control participants, operated patients failed to show context-dependent strategic modulation of response thresholds. The patients with right subthalamotomy could not engage in late phase, fast inhibition of the response and showed minimal proactive inhibition when tested with the contra-lesional hand. These results provide strong evidence that the subthalamic nucleus is involved in response inhibition, in modulating the rate of information accumulation and the response threshold and influencing the balance between speed and accuracy of performance.

  Abstract                 = {In the present study we address the following questions: (1) How is performance affected when patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) perform a dynamic decision making task? (2) Does dopaminergic medication differentially affect dynamic decision making? To address these questions participants were trained with different goals during learning: either they made intervention-based decisions or prediction-based decisions during learning. The findings show that overall there is an advantage for those trained to intervene over those trained to predict. In addition, the results are the first demonstration that PD patients 'ON' (N=20) compared to 'OFF' L-Dopa (N=15) medication and also relative to healthy age matched controls (N=16) showed lower levels of relative improvement in the accuracy of their decisions in a dynamic decision making task, and tended to use sub-optimal strategies. These findings provide support for the 'Dopamine Overdose' hypothesis using a novel decision making task, and suggest that executive functions such as decision making can be adversely affected by dopaminergic medication in PD.},

Participants were presented with a dynamic system which they interacted with by intervening on three cues in order to reach and maintain a specific outcome (goal). The system was manipulated so that in the Stable condition participants controlled an outcome that fluctuated steadily overall trials, and in the Unstable condition the outcome fluctuated erratically over trials. In general, unstable fluctuations in the outcome led people to sample all the cues most of the time, even those which had no effect on the outcome. In contrast, under Stable conditions people were more conservative in their cue sampling behavior. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to previous work on dynamic decision making and the Monitoring and Control (Osman, 2010a, 2010b) framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {A long-standing debate in decision making has been whether people rely on very little information for making choices, or weigh and add all available information. We propose a new method to determine whether a non-compensatory (Take-The-Best) or compensatory strategy (Logistic Regression) is more psychologically plausible: by looking at peopleâs active learning queries. This method goes beyond traditional model selection techniques as it reveals the information people choose to learn early on, which subsequently drives their decisions. We developed active learning algorithms for both Take-The-Best and logistic regression and designed an active learning experiment to psychologically distinguish between these two models. Letting both models and humans actively learn and then comparing their queries, we found that people follow a rank-based learning strategy in non-compensatory environments and prefer more certainty-based queries in compensatory environments. The potential for active learning studies to further tease apart different models of decision making will be discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is proposed to modulate response thresholds and speed-accuracy trade-offs. In situations of conflict, the STN is considered to raise response thresholds, allowing time for the accumulation of information to occur before a response is selected. Conversely, speed pressure is thought to reduce the activity of the STN and lower response thresholds, resulting in fast, errorful responses. In Parkinson's disease (PD), subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) reduces the activity of the nucleus and improves motor symptoms. We predicted that the combined effects of STN stimulation and speed pressure would lower STN activity and lead to fast, errorful responses, hence resulting in impulsive action. We used the motion discrimination 'moving-dots' task to assess speed-accuracy trade-offs, under both speed and accuracy instructions. We assessed 12 patients with PD and bilateral STN-DBS and 12 age-matched healthy controls. Participants completed the task twice, and the patients completed it once with STN-DBS on and once with STN-DBS off, with order counterbalanced. We found that STN stimulation was associated with significantly faster reaction times but more errors under speed instructions. Application of the drift diffusion model showed that stimulation resulted in lower response thresholds when acting under speed pressure. These findings support the involvement of the STN in the modulation of speed-accuracy trade-offs and establish for the first time that speed pressure alone, even in the absence of conflict, can result in STN stimulation inducing impulsive action in PD.},

In a CMAB task, participants are presented with multiple options (arms) which are characterized by a number of features (context) related to the reward associated with the arms. By choosing arms repeatedly and observing the reward, participants can learn about the relation between context and reward and improve their decision strategy. We present two studies on how people behave in CMAB tasks. Within a stationary environment, we find that participants are best described by Thompson Sampling-based Gaussian Process models. In a dynamic CMAB task we again find that participants are best described by probability matching of Gaussian Process expectations. Our findings imply that behavior previously referred to as "irrational" can actually be seen as a well-adapted strategy based on powerful inference algorithms.},

Using this measure, we show that the smoothness of a function can be more important to predictability judgments than the variance of additive noise or the number of samples. These patterns can be captured well by the learning curve for Gaussian process regression, which in turn crucially depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of the covariance function. Using approximate bounds on the learning curve, we model participantsâ predictability judgments about sampled functions and find that smoothness is indeed a better predictor for perceived predictability than both the variance and the sample size. This means that it can sometimes be preferable to learn about noisy but smooth functions instead of deterministic complex ones.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous research suggests that early performance of amnesic individuals in a probabilistic category learning task is relatively unimpaired. When combined with impaired declarative knowledge, this is taken as evidence for the existence of separate implicit and explicit memory systems. The present study contains a more fine-grained analysis of learning than earlier studies. Using a dynamic lens model approach with plausible learning models, we found that the learning process is indeed indistinguishable between an amnesic and control group. However, in contrast to earlier findings, we found that explicit knowledge of the task structure is also good in both the amnesic and the control group. This is inconsistent with a crucial prediction from the multiple-systems account. The results can be explained from a single system account and previously found differences in later categorization performance can be accounted for by a difference in learning rate.},

  Abstract                 = {Probabilistic category learning (PCL) has become an increasingly popular paradigm to study the brain bases of learning and memory. It has been argued that PCL relies on procedural habit learning, which is impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, as PD patients were typically tested under medication, it is possible that levodopa (L-dopa) caused impaired performance in PCL. We present formal models of rule-based strategy switching in PCL, to re-analyse the data from [Jahanshahi, M., Wilkinson, L, Gahir, H., Dharminda, A., \& Lagnado, D.A., (2009). Medication impairs probabilistic classification learning in Parkinson's disease. Manuscript submitted for publication] comparing PD patients on and off medication (within subjects) to matched controls. Our analysis shows that PD patients followed a similar strategy switch process as controls when off medication, but not when on medication. On medication, PD patients mainly followed a random guessing strategy, with only few switching to the better Single Cue strategies. PD patients on medication and controls made more use of the optimal Multi-Cue strategy. In addition, while controls and PD patients off medication only switched to strategies which did not decrease performance, strategy switches of PD patients on medication were not always directed as such. Finally, results indicated that PD patients on medication responded according to a probability matching strategy indicative of associative learning, while the behaviour of PD patients off medication and controls was consistent with a rule-based hypothesis testing procedure.

A fine-grained analysis of the learning dynamics shows that participants were responsive to both abrupt and gradual changes in cue-outcome relations. We found no evidence that participants adapted to these types of change in qualitatively different ways. Also, in contrast to earlier claims that these tasks are learned implicitly, participants showed good insight into what they learned. By fitting formal learning models, we investigated whether participants learned global functional relationships or made localized predictions from similar experienced exemplars. Both a local (the associative learning model) and a global learning model (the Bayesian linear filter) fitted the data of the first 2 experiments. However, the results of Experiment 3, which was specifically designed to discriminate between local and global learning models, provided more support for global learning models. Finally, we present a novel model to account for the cue competition effects found in previous research and displayed by some of our participants.},

  Abstract                 = {Judgmental detection of changes in time series is an ubiquitous task. Previous research has shown that human observers are often relatively poor at detecting change, especially when the series are serially dependent (autocorrelated). We present two experiments in which participants were asked to judge the occurrence of changes in time series with varying levels of autocorrelation. Results show that autocorrelation increases the difficulty of discriminating change from no change, and that observers respond to this increased difficulty by biasing their decisions towards change. This results in increased false alarm rates, while leaving hit rates relatively intact. We present a rational (Bayesian) model of change detection and compare it to
two heuristic models that ignore autocorrelation in the series. Participants appeared to rely on a simple heuristic, where they first visually match a change function to a series, and then determine whether the putative change exceeds the variability in

We designed a novel contextual multi-armed bandit task where decision makers chose repeatedly between multiple alternatives characterized by two informative features. We compared human behavior in the contextual task with a classical multi-armed bandit where decision makers did not have access to feature information. Behavioral analysis showed that participants in the contextual bandit used features to direct their exploration for promising alternatives. Ex post, we tested the participants functional knowledge in one shot multi-feature choice trilemmas. We computationally modeled the behavior of the participants and compared a novel function learning based reinforcement learning model with classical reinforcement learning. Although classical reinforcement learning models predict behavior better in the bandit experiment, new models do better in predicting the trilemma choices.},

The basic model for detecting such change is the latent or hidden Markov model. Traditionally, these models were restricted to categorical, mostly binary, observed variables, placing severe restrictions on possible measurement models. In this paper, the basic model is extended to include various distributions for the observed variables, including mixed multi-variate distributions. Moreover, there is an option to include time-varying predictors on the observed distributions. In effect, this model consists of mixtures of generalized linear models with Markovian dependencies over time to model the change process. In addition, the transition parameters can be estimated with covariates, such that the switching regime between states depends on characteristics of the individual or the experimental situation. The model is illustrated with examples of participants' learning in the Iowa Gambling Task and in the Weather Prediction Task.},

Dynamical systems models with multiple stable states or modes of behavior are also increasingly used in explaining cognitive phenomena. Catastrophe theory provides a formal framework for studying the dynamics of switching between two qualitatively distinct modes of behavior. Here we present a parametric approach to testing specific predictions about the dynamics of such switches that follow from catastrophe theory. These so-called catastrophe flags are bimodality, divergence, and hysteresis. We show how these three flags can be tested using (constrained) mixture and hidden Markov models and provide an example of each using three different data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {depmixS4 implements a general framework for defining and estimating dependent mixture models in the R programming language. This includes standard Markov models, latent/hidden Markov models, and latent class and finite mixture distribution models. The models can be fitted on mixed multivariate data with distributions from the glm family, the (logistic) multinomial, or the multivariate normal distribution. Other distributions can be added easily, and an example is provided with the exgaus distribution. Parameters are estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or, when (linear) constraints are imposed on the parameters, by direct numerical optimization with the Rsolnp or Rdonlp2 routines.},
