# Join us

<h2>Open positions</h2>
<p>
There are currently no open advertised positions.
</p>

<h2>Postdoctoral Fellows</h2>
<p>
Maarten is happy to discuss fellowship applications or postdoctoral projects. If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoctoral fellow, please get in touch with details of your research plans and a CV.
</p>

<h2>PhD Positions</h2>
<p>
We will be able to accept 1-2 PhD students to start in September 2023.
</p)>

<p>
There are generally two routes into doing a PhD in the lab. The first is via direct application to the Department of Experimental Psychology which funds a limited number of places via demonstratorships (TA positions) - see <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/graduate-programmes/how-to-apply/">here</a> for more details. If this is of interest, please make sure to contact Maarten well in advance of the January deadline (ideally in the summer before applying).
</p>

<p>
The second route is to apply directly to Doctoral Training Centres, who offer 3- or 4-year programmes (for instance, the UCL Ecological Brain Programme, Wellcome 4-year PhD in Mental Health, IMPRS COMP2PSYCH or the Wellcome PhD Programme for Clinicians). If you have a place on one of these programmes feel free to get in touch, as we can usually offer rotation projects during your first year that lead into full-time PhD study.
</p>

<p>
A final route is via a personal scholarship or other source of charity funding (occasionally we have these places to offer from our lab’s funding, at which point they will be advertised - but it’s rare). If you are in this position and interested in joining the lab, please do get in touch.
</p>

<h2>Visitors</h2>

<p>
We are always interested in discussing possible collaborations and hosting academic visitors - please get in touch!
</p>

<h2>Internships and volunteer positions</h2>

<p>Unfortunately we are unable to support student internships or volunteer positions due to priority being given to UCL undergraduate and Masters students seeking laboratory projects.</p>
