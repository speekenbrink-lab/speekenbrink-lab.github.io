# Join us

We are part of the Department of <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology">Experimental Psychology</a> at UCL. UCL, and Experimental Psychology in particular, are a great place to work and study. You will meet many inspiring scientists working on important problems. And all in the heart of London.

<h2>Open positions</h2>

<p>
There are currently no open advertised positions.
</p>

<h2>Postdoctoral Fellows</h2>

<p>
Maarten is happy to discuss fellowship applications or postdoctoral projects. If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoctoral fellow, please get in touch with details of your research plans and your CV.
</p>

<h2>PhD Positions</h2>

<p>
We will be able to accept 1 or 2 PhD students to start in September 2023.
</p>

<p>
There are two main routes for a PhD student position in our lab. The first route is via direct application to the UCL Department of Experimental Psychology. Each year, UCL Experimental Psychology funds a limited number of places via demonstratorships (TA positions) - see <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/experimental-psychology/graduate-programmes/how-to-apply/">here</a> for more details. Currently, these positions are only available to UK applicants. Excellent applicants may also be put forward for a UCL-funded scholarship, which are available to a limited number of <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/scholarships/graduate/UK-EU_Res/grs">UK</a> and <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/scholarships/graduate/overs-res/ors">international</a> students students. These scholarships are very competitive, so there is no guarantee whatsoever you will get one - no matter how good your application. If this is of interest, please contact Maarten well in advance of the early January deadline.
</p>

<p>
The second route is to apply directly to Doctoral Training Centres (DTCs), which offer 3-year (PhD only) or 4-year (Mres + PhD) funded programmes. Examples of suitable DTCs are the ESRC-funded UCL, Bloomsbury and East London Doctoral Training Partnership (<a href="https://ubel-dtp.ac.uk/">UBEL</a>) and the Leverhulme Doctoral Training Programme
for the Ecological Study (<a href="https://ecologicalbrain.org/">Ecological Brain DTP</a>). For more computational or AI-related projects, there is also an <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epsrc-doctoral-training/">EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership</a>. If you have a place on one of these programmes and are interested in working with us, do contact Maarten, as we may be able to offer rotation projects during your first year and/or supervision of your full-time PhD study.
</p>

<p>
A final route is via a personal scholarship or other source of <a href="https://www.findaphd.com/guides/phd-funding-charities">charity funding</a>. This route may be particularly relevant to international PhD applicants. If you have secured - or are likely to secure - funding via this route, and are interested in joining the lab, contact Maarten to discuss possibilities.
</p>

<h2>Collaborators and visitors</h2>

<p>
We are always interested in discussing possible collaborations and hosting academic visitors. If you would like to collaborate with or be an academic visitor to our lab, get in touch with Maarten.
</p>

<h2>Internships and volunteer positions</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, we are generally <b>not</b> able to support internships or volunteer positions. Our capacity (desk space) and funding is limited, and we have to prioritise UCL undergraduate and Masters students for research projects.</p>
