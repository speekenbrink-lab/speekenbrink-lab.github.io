The goal of our research is to understand the learning and decision processes which allow humans to function effectively in an uncertain and dynamic world.
By developing computational models and assessing how they compare to human behaviour in experimental tasks, we hope to gain deeper insight into how
information is processed and represented during learning and decision making.
