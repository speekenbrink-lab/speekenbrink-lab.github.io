# Participate

<p>
We tend to use recruitment sites like <a href="https://www.prolific.co/">Prolific</a> to run our studies initially. We will post links here when these studies are live.
</p>

<p>
We also keep some studies open after initial data collection, to collect more data and for demonstration purposes. Note that experiments indicated as (multiplayer) require multiple people to participate at the same time, so you may have to wait a while before you can start. It might help to invite your friends to participate as well.</p>
<p>You can try the following studies now:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://palsws07.psychlangsci.ucl.ac.uk/runjamierun/">Run Jamie Run</a></b> (multiplayer) Help Jamie run around town and collect coins. Other players are running around at the same time. Make sure to top up on energy, but beware of too much pollution!
</li>
</ul>
