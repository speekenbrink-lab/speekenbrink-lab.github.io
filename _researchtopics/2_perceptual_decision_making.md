Many decisions can be supported by evidence. We are interested
in how people evaluate and integrate different sources of
information and how this relates to characteristics of the
evidence sources such as their reliability. Perceptual decision
making is an area in which these characteristics can be
precisely controlled. While it is known that the perceptual
system integrates information (close to) optimally, the
precise mechanisms which allow this performance are not
fully understood yet.
