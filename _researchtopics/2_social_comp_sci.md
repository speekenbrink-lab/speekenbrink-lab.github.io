Many psychiatric disorders are chiefly characterised by deficits in social
functioning, such as borderline personality disorder, psychopathy, social
anxiety and autism spectrum disorder. Others exhibit social interaction
impairments as a debilitating consequence of the disorder, such as higher
distress from interpersonal relationships in depression and interpersonal
aggression as a barrier to effective treatment in PTSD. While there is
little disagreement on the importance of understanding social interaction
impairment in many of these disorders, there remains multiple unanswered
questions as to what exactly in the social cognitive process is impaired
or dysfunctional compared to healthy individuals. There are likely multiple
dimensions that can interact to yield the observed atypical behaviour in
social interaction such as such as how sensitive is the person to specific
social gestures, how good they are at inferring others intentions from their
behaviour and their ability to accurately infer social uncertainty from the
history of interactions.

The objective of the research project is to
explore and hopefully learn to disentangle these dimensions through
computationally modelling behaviour in repeated economic games with
social components. Along the way, we hope to develop behavioural markers
of social dysfunction in mental disorders that can be used to diagnose,
monitor and better understand the determinants of social learning
impairment inherent to many conditions.
