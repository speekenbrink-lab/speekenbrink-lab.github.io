Given the dire news about global warming, we often ask why people don't do
more to protect the environment. But let's look at it from a different
angle: Why would you engage in behaviour to mitigate climate change?

Almost all energy-saving behaviours have two things in common:
<ol>
<li>A certain cost (from going the extra mile to recycle glass bottles
at a designated container to installing insulation on your house)</li>
<li>The fact that a single individual's contribution is minimal and cannot,
in itself, determine the desirable outcome (however much you do, one person
drastically reducing energy use will not reverse the impacts of climate
change).</li>
</ol>
Given the cost and the insignificance of the individual behaviour, it would
seem rational to free-ride, i.e., not contribute to the generation of
this "Public Good" and instead take advantage of other people's
contributions. However, as the number of free-riders increases, the system
breaks and everyone is in a worse position than had they contributed in the
first instance. In Game Theory this is known as the "Tragedy of the
Commons". Different ways to avoid the Tragedy of the Commons have
previously been discussed, e.g. privatisation of the commons or punishment
for free-riders. With regards to climate change, these options are limited:
Privatisation only works for certain goods (for instance, air and water
cannot be privatised); punishment requires agreement on policies and is
difficult to implement on a global scale.

In this project, we are thus looking at a third option, namely how
cooperation can evolve in the creation of Public Goods. We focus on how
behaviours and their traces (i.e., signs of the behaviour that remain in
the shared, physical environment) can foster cooperation without direct
communication and, crucially, without coercion.
