blurb: Optimize experiments whilst you run them
---

Experiments are usually designed "statically", before they
are conducted. While this allows a large
degree of experimenter control, in order to design an experiment
optimally, we usually need to know
quite a bit about the expected behaviour of participants in an
experiment. Moreover, even if we
succeed in designing an experiment optimally for an average participant, when there are large
individual differences, the design will be suboptimal for a large proportion of participants. In
adaptive design, an experiment is designed "on the fly", while it is running. Using computational
models, we can determine relevant characteristics of a participant from their earlier behaviour, and
tailor the design to the participant. This can have substantial benefits when conducting studies to
e.g. compare different theories.
