This website was programmed with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the bare framework started with the Jekyll [default theme](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new). The theme is adapted from the theme used in the old Speekenbrink-lab website. The theme uses [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com); in particular the [SASS port](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).

The fonts used include [Bangers](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bangers), [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), and [academicons](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/).

The logo was made with [StructureSynth](http://structuresynth.sourceforge.net/), based on the "Binary Kite".

The full source code of the website is available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/speekenbrink-lab/speekenbrink-lab.github.io).
